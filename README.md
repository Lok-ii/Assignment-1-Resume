In this first screenshot attached above :-
    
    In the first line We have "!DOCTYPE html", which declares the document type
    
    "html" tag, which defines the whole html document.
    
    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag)

In this second screenshot :- 
    
    "body" tag define the document's body, it is used for all the content we want to show on our webpage.
    "h1" is a heading tag which is used to give headings to the content (there are 6 of them, h1 is used for the most important headings, and it keeps reducing to h6).
    Then comes the "p" tag, which is used to write paragraphs or any kind of text or lines.
    After that, "a" tag is used, which is the anchor tag and it is used to define the hyperlink. we can wrap any text inside the anchor tag to make it work as a link and the "href" attribute inside the tag holds the url of the page the link goes to.
    Then there's the "hr" tag which is used to basically draw a separator or a horizontal line.

In this third screenshot :-
   
    Again two heading tags are used, "h2" is used for heading but it is smaller than the "h1" tag and "h3" is smaller than "h2".
    Then comes the paragraph tag "p" but this time a break tag is used inside the paragraph tag. "br" tag breaks the line and anything after that starts from the next line.
    Once more the "hr" tag is used for the horizontal rule/line.
    "h3" and "p" tags repeats again.

In this fourth screenshot :- 
    
    "h3" tag is used for heading.
    After that "ul" tag is used which is used to create an unordered list and inside the unordered list "li" tag is used to create the list data/item.
    Then comes the "hr" tag again for the horizontal line.
    Then I have used "h3" tag for a heading and after that "ol" tag is used to create an ordered list and inside the ordered list "li" is used to create the list data/items.
    In the end "hr" tag is used again for the horizontal line.

In this last screenshot :-
    
    Firstly a "h3" tag for a heading.
    
    Then I have used a "dl" tag which is used to create a description list, which is a list of items, with a description of each item and they are paired together.
    
    Inside the description list, there are two more tag related to the description list itself, first is "dt" tag which define the item and second is the "dd" tag, which is used to describe the item.
    
    Then I have used the "hr" tag again.
    
    After that, "pre" tag is used, it is used to print or show the content as it is inside the pre tag. It will be displayed in the same format as it is written inside the pre tag.

    Then there is body closing tag and the html closing tag.
